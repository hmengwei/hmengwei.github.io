Hello! I am a 5th-year math graduate student at [Yale](https://math.yale.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Ivan Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/).

I study geometric representation theory. I am interested in Harish-Chandra modules, deformation quantizations, Nakajima quiver varieties, and nilpotent orbits.

<!---Here ia my [CV]().-->
