Hello! I am a 5th-year graduate student studying geometric representation theory at [Yale](https://math.yale.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Ivan Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/). I am interested in Harish-Chandra modules, deformation quantizations, Nakajima quiver varieties, and nilpotent orbits.
